##### Introduction
Psuedo-classes are great for targeting a certain aspect or state of an entire element. The :target pseudo-class is a great way to style HTML elements when they are called upon by using their ID. This is useful for a sliding navigation menu, image gallery, lightbox, and more.

##### Fragment Identifiers
You can begin to utilize this particular pseudo-class with the help of hash URLs, or fragment identifiers. Fragment identifiers target a specific portion of the webpage which is an HTML element with an ID attribute value that matches the URL. A common instance is when a user clicks an anchor tag with a href attribute value that matches an HTML elementâ€™s ID attribute value:
```html
<p>some html code</p>
```
