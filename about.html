            <p class="main-p text-center">Hello! My name is David Horn and I live in Denver, Colorado. I am a freelance web designer most of the time, but I also enjoy hiking, lifting weights, reading and taco nights. If you want to get in contact with me you can message me through several online platforms including twitter and email. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="main-p text-center">I am very passionate about websites and how their designs can affect their relationship with users. I can design websites and their components with a vision for wide accessibility, usability and positive user experiences. I can help you solve web design problems using prototype designs and user testing. I also build websites using best-practice web standards.</p>
