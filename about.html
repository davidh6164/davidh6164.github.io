            <p class="main-p text-center">Hello, my name is David Horn. I am a web designer that focuses on UI Design, but I also develop small to medium size websites for individuals, companies and organizations. I live in Denver, Colorado where I spend my time as a freelance web designer most of the time, but I also enjoy hiking, lifting weights, reading and late night pizza. If you want to get in contact with me you can message me through several online platforms including twitter and email. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="main-p text-center">I am very passionate about websites and how their designs can affect their relationship with users. I can design websites and their components with a vision for wide accessibility, usability and positive user experiences. I can help you solve web design problems using prototype designs and user testing. I ensure websites are built using best-practice web standards.</p>
