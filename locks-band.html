            <h4 class="text-center">Web Design</h4>
            <p class="main-p text-center">This project was a project for a fictitious customer who required a website for their band. For this particular website design I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery. I started off with some simple sketches and planning. I then moved on to creating some wireframes to expand my design vision. The images are from free web sources such as Pexels. This project is currently not hosted anywhere online.</p>

            <p class="main-p text-center">I had some ideas in mind when it came to the website's design and layout, so I assembled those ideas together in a wireframe.</p>

            <p class="main-p text-center">I thought it would be considered an essential feature to have tour dates and links in place to be able to easily direct visitors of the website to third-party ticket vendors for selecting and buying seats through the venues.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Responsive Design</h2>
            <p class="main-p text-center">Responsive Web Design means that the website's design is fluid across various browser sizes and devices. As people access the internet from various devices such as smart phones and tablets, websites need to be as accessible and usable as they are on desktops. An effective web design is a responsive design. Using Bootstrap, I ensured the Tesla Motors Mockup design is mobile-first and fluid across all browser sizes.</p>
