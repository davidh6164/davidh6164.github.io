            <p class="main-p text-center">This project was a project for a fictitious customer who required a website for their band. For this particular website design I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery. I started off with some simple sketches and planning. I then moved on to creating some wireframes to expand my design vision. The images are from free web sources such as Pexels. This project is currently not hosted anywhere online.</p>

            <p class="main-p text-center">The Tesla Motors website already had a lot of great text content that I did not want to change, my focus was changing the web design which I did. I recreated the home page web design starting with some sketches and wireframes before coding.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Responsive Design</h2>
            <p class="main-p text-center">Responsive Web Design means that the website's design is fluid across various browser sizes and devices. As people access the internet from various devices such as smart phones and tablets, websites need to be as accessible and usable as they are on desktops. An effective web design is a responsive design. Using Bootstrap, I ensured the Tesla Motors Mockup design is mobile-first and fluid across all browser sizes.</p>
