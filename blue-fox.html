            <p class="main-p text-center">Blue Fox Furnishings is a Rustic Wood Furnishings store. They were originally selling their products through the Etsy Marketplace, but as their business expanded they wanted to grow as well launching their first website where you can buy products directly from Blue Fox Furnishings. After weeks of planning, we figured out branding and a complete web design. I started the process with some initial sketches, then I expanded the sketches with low-fidelity wireframes. I started coding using HTML and CSS  along with Bootstrap and jQuery. This design was built upon Magento for essential security and functionality.</p>
