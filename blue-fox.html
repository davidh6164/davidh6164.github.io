            <h4 class="text-center">Website | Web Design</h4>
            <p class="main-p text-center">Blue Fox Furnishings is a Rustic Wood Furnishings store. They were originally selling their products through the Etsy Marketplace, but as their business expanded they wanted to grow as well. I helped them launch their first website where you can buy products directly from Blue Fox Furnishings. After weeks of planning, we figured out branding and a complete web design. I started the process with some initial sketches, then I expanded the sketches with low-fidelity wireframes. I started coding using HTML and CSS  along with Bootstrap and jQuery. This design was built upon Magento for essential security and functionality.</p>
